This project demonstrates the use of the CERES library to solve various optimization problems. Currently, the project includes two solved problems: finding the equation of a 2D line and finding the axis, center, and radius of a cylinder given some data points.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you must have the following installed on your system:

- CMake (version 3.0 or higher)
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CERES Solver (version 2.0 or higher)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a `build` folder inside the project directory.
4. Enter the `build` folder with `cd build`.
5. Run `cmake ..` to generate the build files.
6. Run `make` to build the project.
7. Run the executable file generated in the `build` directory.

## Usage

### Finding the Equation of a 2D Line

To find the equation of a 2D line, run the executable file and provide the data points as input. The program will optimize the parameters of the line equation to fit the given data points.

### Finding the Axis, Center, and Radius of a Cylinder

To find the axis, center, and radius of a cylinder, run the executable file and provide the data points as input. The program will optimize the parameters of the cylinder equation to fit the given data points.
